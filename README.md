#### FUTURE SCOPE OF THE PROJECT
DevQuiz have a lot of scope in future wherevarious modules can be upgraded.

1. Scalability: The online industry's growth increases demand for skilled coders. Software
solutions like this are crucial for bridging skill gaps. Thus, systems must prioritize
scalability for seamless adaptation to changing needs.

2. Learnable: In today's rapidly evolving tech landscape, DevQuiz provides an accessible
solution for honing coding skills. Whether you're a beginner or expert, our interface
simplifies skill evaluation, helping you meet industry standards.

3. Integration: Businesses use multiple software solutions, and it is necessary to ensure that
the management system can integrate with other tools to streamlineprocesses and data
transfer.

4. Analytics and Reporting: Businesses need to track the performance of new freshers and
make data-driven decisions. Therefore, the management system should have advanced
analytics and reporting capabilities.

5. Mobile Compatibility: In today's world, businesses need to have mobile compatibility
to allow users to access the system from anywhere.
